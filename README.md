Title: Blogging Platform

Description:
This project is a full-stack blogging platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It allows users to read blog posts after registration and login, with different levels of access and permissions. Users can view the full blog content, while editors can edit posts, and admins have additional privileges like posting and deleting blog content. Authentication is implemented using JWT tokens (AccessToken and RefreshToken), ensuring secure access to the platform. Other features include persisting login sessions, logout functionality, Axios for HTTP requests, Axios interceptors for token management, and Multer for handling file uploads. State management is achieved through React Context API with useContext. The platform is also fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices.
